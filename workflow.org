Feature Branch Workflow
* Setting up
** Clone the puppetlabs/puppet-docs repo
   git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs/ --origin upstream
** Fork the project and add your private remote (optional)
   git remote add <NAME> https://github.com/<NAME>/puppet-docs
* Publishing a single, small change
** Update your copy of the repo
   git up
** Edit the file/s
** Add (stage) the file/s
   git add file1 file2
** Commit the changes
   git commit -m "Corrected capitalization in two files"
   (note: the above two steps can be combined with `git commit -am "Message"`, but that risks committing extra files unintentionally)
** Push to master
   git push upstream master
* Publishing a larger section of work
** Create a feature branch and check it out
   git branch facter3
   git checkout facter3
** Edit, add, and commit your changes until you're ready to publish
** Either push your changes to github and submit a pull request -or-
** Merge your changes into master
   git checkout master
   git up
   git merge facter3
/  git merge facter3 --squash && git commit -am "Added docs for Facter 3"
   git push
