# Docs Workflow (Better Git it in Your Soul)

## Abstract

The docs team uses a relatively simple git workflow based on [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/) (not to be confused with Git Flow). In GitHub Flow, team members create branches off of "master" to work on, then submit a pull request to have their changes deployed. You should definitely read that page if you haven't already; it gives a great high-level overview of the process.

The classic GitHub Flow is great for more involved docs projects, but it's overkill for much of the work that we do. On docs, we relax it in two important ways:

  1. If you're making a fairly small change and you feel like you can get it right in one commit, then go ahead and commit to master.
  2. If you think your branch is ready to merge and you don't see any need for review, then it's perfectly fine to merge it yourself and skip the pull request step.

## General Advice

Git is complicated, and new users pretty much always find it frustrating (if not downright scary) at first. That said, I think that the all-too-common approach of "just teach people the five basic commands and hope for the best" actually does more harm than good. Taking the time early on to learn about the way that git organizes commits and branches will not only make the rest of the process vastly more intuitive, it will save you loads of time and frustration in the future.

A good goal is to be able to draw what's going on in the form of a graph like this:

![Git Graph](graph.png)

There are countless tutorials and books out there, and you may find some more suited to your learning style than others. [Atlassian's Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial) is a great, highly visual guide to git concepts. For a more comprehensive approach, several of us on the team like O'Reilly's [Version Control with Git](http://www.amazon.com/Version-Control-Git-collaborative-development/dp/1449316387), and recommend it for people who are willing to put in a bit more time.

It's not a tutorial in itself, but one way that you can build up your mental model of git processes is to use a tool like [Explain Git With D3](http://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/), which lets you type in git commands and see how they affect the graph immediately.

## Setting Up

### Install git

  1. [Download git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and run the installer.
  2. Follow GitHub's [instructions for generating an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).
  3. Download the [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/release-notes.html) application if you prefer a graphical interface. Using the app is explained in more detail in the [quickstart guide](quickstart.markdown).

### Install git-up

Keeping your local repository up to date is a must, and even though `git pull` is usually just fine, it tends to error out under the least bit of provocation. The [git-up](https://github.com/aanand/git-up) gem provides an alternate `git up` command that will reliably update your local repository without complaining about your unsaved work or introducing unnecessary commits. It also has the nice benefit of updating all of the local branches, not just the one that's currently checked out. To install it, just type the following at the command line:

    sudo gem install git-up

### Install hub

GitHub has a handy tool called [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) that wraps around the normal git program and provides some GitHub-specific functions. If you install it, you can use new commands like `git fork`, `git pull-request`. It also enables a general shorthand for GitHub repos, so that you can replace `git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs` with `git clone puppetlabs/puppet-docs`.

### Helpful Aliases and Settings

You can save yourself a lot of typing at the command line and build better habits by setting up git **aliases** for common commands---or even sequences of commands. Aliases are defined in `~/.gitconfig` in the `[alias]` section like so:

    [alias]
      ci = commit

Once that's defined, you can type `git ci` instead of `git commit` and save yourself a few keystrokes. Here are a few more along similar lines:

      st = status
      br = branch
      co = checkout

That's fine, but aliases can get much more complicated:

      graph = log --all --graph --decorate --oneline -n30

The above alias sets up a new command, `git graph`, that shows a colorized history of recent commits with a graph.

While you're editing `~/.gitconfig`, you should probably add the following lines at the bottom:

    [pull]
      ff = only
      rebase = true

These settings change some potentially annoying behavior of `git pull` in two important ways:

  1. `git pull` will not merge unless it can fast forward, i.e., unless there are no local changes that haven't been published.
  2. If there are local changes, it will try to [rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/rewriting-git-history#!rebase) them to keep the history nice and neat.
  3. If you have local changes that conflict with the master branch, you'll have to resolve those [merge conflicts](#merge-conflicts)

Neither of these settings will necessarily prevent merge conflicts, which this document covers in a later section. We also recommend a few more settings for the merge and push sections:

    [merge]
      defaultToUpstream = true
    [push]
      default = upstream

### Clone the puppetlabs/puppet-docs repository

You should run `git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs/ --origin upstream` to make sure that the puppetlabs repository is named `upstream` rather than the ambiguous `origin`. The difference between the two is this:

  * Git names the "origin" remote for you based on the source that you cloned from. It might be the original repository, or it might be another fork.
  * On the other hand, "upstream" is taken to mean *the repository accepted as authoritative*, in our case, that's `https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs`.

### Add your own remote (optional)

It's not required, but you should consider forking the puppet-docs repo and adding a remote for it. If you installed [hub](https://github.com/github/hub), all you need to do is type `git fork`. Otherwise, click the "Fork" button at the top of the [GitHub page for the repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs) and then run the following command:

    git remote add <YOUR USERNAME> https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/puppet-docs

Once you do that, you can push your commits to `myname` instead of `upstream` and they won't be deployed to the site.

## Writing and Publishing

Let's look at a simple example: fixing a typo in `index.markdown`. Here's how it should go:

  1. `git pull` the repo to make sure that you have the latest version.
  2. Edit `index.markdown` your text editor of choice.
  3. `git status` should show something like this:

          Changes not staged for commit:
            (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
            (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   index.markdown

  4. Use `git add index.markdown` to stage the file so that it will be included in the next commit.
  5. Commit the change with `git commit -m "Fixed a typo in the index`.
  6. Publish the commit with `git push`.

It doesn't get much simpler than that, and often that's all you need. The commit message in step 5 above (marked with the `-m` or `--message` flag)

### Committing

We've historically been pretty lax when it comes to commit messages, but there are a few things that you should keep in mind:

  1. Commit messages are not only open to the public, they're proudly displayed in a sidebar on the docs site. Remember that when you're writing them.
  2. Give a clear indication of what the commit relates to up front. The first 50 characters or so of a commit message are the most important, because sometimes that's all you can see when you're looking through the history of a branch.
  3. If the commit resolves a ticket, reference the ticket number somewhere in the commit message.

### Branching

[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/) mandates that all work be done on a branch other than master, but that's not really practical for us. You should at least *consider* making a new branch for each task, but it's not required for quick changes.

To create a new branch based on the current (i.e., HEAD) commit, just use the `git branch <BRANCH NAME>` command. You can also create the branch and check it out in one command with `git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME>`. Choose a descriptive name for your branch, something like `hiera186` or `razor2`.

It's a good idea to keep your branch online by pushing it to either your own fork, the puppetlabs/puppet-docs repo, or (if you're working on sensitive material) the puppetlabs/puppet-docs-private repo.

### Merging/Pull Requests

You are welcome to merge your own work into master yourself when you think it's ready. This is a bit of a departure from the GitHub Flow workflow, but the fact of the matter is that most of the changes we make are pretty minor and it would be unwise to require secondary review for everything. To merge another branch into master from the command line, follow these steps:

  1. Make sure all branches are current: `git up`
  2. Switch to the master branch: `git checkout master`
  3. Merge your branch: `git merge <BRANCH>` (this might trigger a [merge conflict](#merge-conflicts))
  4. Push your updated master branch: `git push`

If you don't want it to go live until somebody else has had a look at it, here's what you should do:

  1. Make sure all branches are current: `git up`
  2. Switch to your branch: `git checkout <BRANCH>`
  3. Rebase your branch against the master branch: `git rebase upstream/master` (this might trigger a [merge conflict](#merge-conflicts))
  4. Upload your branch: `git push <BRANCH>`
  5. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) targeting the master branch.
  6. In the body of the pull request, @tag at least one person and let them know what you need (technical review, copy-editing, etc.). Politely mention any time constraints you might be under.

## Less-Than-Ideal Situations

From time to time, you will inevitably find yourself in a shallow pit of git-related despair. Thankfully, there's always a way out.

### Merge Conflicts

When you're combining two branches with `git merge` or `git rebase`, git usually doesn't complain *unless* the branches have conflicting versions of one or more files. It's important to note that "conflicting" doesn't just mean "different," it means "different because of two (or more) divergent editing histories." In general, you get merge conflicts after two people have been editing the same file concurrently.

Merge conflicts are common enough that a number of tools have been developed just to resolve them. Some of us on the team use a commercial merge tool called [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) which has a pretty nice interface and makes the process almost painless. You can also resolve merge conflicts manually, but I wouldn't recommend it. For the following steps, I'll assume that you have installed Kaleidoscope and made it git's default diff and merge tool (see "File > Integration" in the app).

Here's what git tells you when there's a merge conflict:
    
    Auto-merging index.markdown
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.markdown
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Ok, maybe not that helpful. It's a good thing that you've got a tool prepared for just this sort of situation. Run `git mergetool` to launch Kaleidoscope and you'll see something like this:

![Merging with Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope-merge.jpg)

  1. The left shows the "LOCAL" copy, which is probably going to be master.
  2. The center pane is the final version. Whatever ends up here will live on; everything else will be lost.
  3. The right shows the "REMOTE" copy, which is the branch you're taking content from.
  4. If you just want to go block-by-block and choose one or the other, these buttons will help you either grab the left (master) version or the right version.
  However, if you want to keep both, you can copy/paste from both sides into the center, and even add some text yourself if they need a little bit of contextual glue.
  
Once you're done, just save the file and close it. Git will notice that the conflicts have been resolved and it will stage (i.e. `git add`) the file again. You just have to commit the changes and then you can get on with your life.

### Amending Commits and Rewriting History

**Important:** You can amend commits all you want *if and only if* those commits have not been pushed to puppetlabs/puppet-docs.

If you made a typo in your last commit message or forgot to add a file, you can use `git commit --amend` to go back and fix it. If you're comfortable with [interactive rebasing](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) then you're welcome to use it, but it shouldn't be strictly necessary.

### Getting a Fresh Start

If you've gotten yourself into such a jam that you just want to start with a fresh copy of upstream master, check out the master branch and then do `get fetch upstream` followed by `git reset --hard upstream/master`. **Warning**: this will **erase** any work that you have in the master branch that hasn't been pushed. Use it with care.

### Fixing This Error: "fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository"

When you clone a repository, git creates a new remote for the source and calls it "origin." That means that there's no "upstream" remote by default. If you cloned puppetlabs/puppet-docs (and I'm pretty sure that you did), then you can rename origin to upstream with this command: `git remote rename origin upstream`. That should solve the problem.

### Basing Work on Content That's Still Being Updated

On the PE side, writers often need to update existing documentation in place while preparing parallel versions of the same documents for the next release. Some of the in-place updates will be applicable to the future docs, but not all of them. The workflow that enables this process is explained in a separate document.
